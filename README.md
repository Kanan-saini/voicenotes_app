# 📝 Voice Notes App – A Flutter Notes & Recorder

A simple and efficient Flutter application to take notes in **text** or **voice**.  
Voice notes are automatically **transcribed into text**, and you can **search** across both typed and spoken content.  
This app is a great mini-project to demonstrate Flutter plugins, local storage, and smart search features.
